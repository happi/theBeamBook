== Chapter: Interfacing other languages and extending BEAM and ERTS

=== Introduction
Interfacing C, C++, Ruby, or assembler provides an opportunity to extend the capabilities of the BEAM. In this chapter, we will use C for most examples, but the methods described can be used to interface almost any other programming language. We will give some examples of Ruby and Java in this chapter. In most cases, you can replace C with any other language in the rest of this chapter, but we will just use C for brevity.

By integrating C code, developers can enhance their Erlang applications' performance, especially for computationally intensive tasks requiring direct access to system-level resources. Additionally, interfacing with C allows Erlang applications to interact directly with hardware and system-level resources. This capability is crucial for applications that require low-level operations, such as manipulating memory, accessing specialized hardware, or performing real-time data processing. Another advantage of integrating C with Erlang is using existing C libraries and codebases. Many powerful libraries and tools are available in C, and by interfacing with them, Erlang developers can incorporate these functionalities without having to reimplement them in Erlang.

Furthermore, interfacing with C can help when precise control over execution is necessary. While Erlang's virtual machine provides excellent concurrency management, certain real-time applications may require more deterministic behavior that can be better achieved with C. By integrating C code, developers can fine-tune the performance and behavior of their applications to meet specific requirements.

C code can also extend ERTS and BEAM since they are written in C.

In previous chapters, we have seen how you can safely interface other applications
and services over sockets or ports. This chapter will look at ways to interface low-level code more directly, which also means using it more unsafely.

The official documentation contains a tutorial on interoperability, see link:https://www.erlang.org/doc/tutorial/introduction[Interoperability Tutorial].

==== Safe Ways of Interfacing C Code

Interfacing C code with Erlang can be done safely using several mechanisms that minimize the risk of destabilizing the BEAM virtual machine. Here are the primary methods.

===== os:cmd
The `os:cmd` function allows Erlang processes to execute shell commands and retrieve their output. This method is safe because it runs the command in a separate OS process, isolating it from the BEAM VM. By using `os:cmd`, developers can interact with external C programs without directly affecting the Erlang runtime environment. It comes with an overhead and the C program is expected to be a standalone program that can be run from the command line and return the result on standard output.

Example:
```C
// system_time.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

void get_system_time()
{
    time_t rawtime;
    struct tm *timeinfo;

    time(&rawtime);
    timeinfo = localtime(&rawtime);

    printf("Current Date and Time: %s", asctime(timeinfo));
}

int main()
{
    get_system_time();
    return 0;
}
```

```erlang
> os:cmd("./time").
"Current Date and Time: Mon May 20 04:46:37 2024\n"
```

===== 'open_port' 'spawn_executable'
An even safer way to interact with a program, especially when arguments are based on user input, is to use open_port with the spawn_executable argument. This method mitigates the risk of argument injection by passing the arguments directly to the executable without involving an operating system shell. This direct passing prevents the shell from interpreting the arguments, thus avoiding potential injection attacks that could arise from special characters or commands in the user input.

```erlang
1> Port = open_port({spawn_executable, "./time"}, [{args, []}, exit_status]).
#Port<0.7>
2> receive {Port, {data, R}} -> R after 1000 -> timeout end.
"Current Date and Time: Mon May 20 13:59:32 2024\n"
```

You can also spawn a port with a program that reads from standard input and writes to standard output,
and send and receive data to and from the port.

Example:

```erlang
Port = open_port({spawn, "./system_time"}, [binary]),
port_command(Port, <<"get_time\n">>).
```

See xref:CH-IO[] for more details on how to use port drivers to connect to external programs.

===== Sockets
Sockets provide a straightforward way to enable communication between Erlang and external C programs. By using TCP or UDP sockets, C applications can exchange data with Erlang processes over the network, ensuring that both systems remain isolated. This method is particularly useful for distributed systems and allows for asynchronous communication.

The most common and easiest way is to use a REST-like interface over HTTP or HTTPS. There are Erlang libraries for both client and server implementations, such as `httpc` for HTTP clients and `cowboy` for HTTP servers. This approach allows C applications to expose APIs that Erlang processes can call, facilitating interaction over a well-defined protocol.

The next level is to use pure socket communication, which can be more efficient than HTTP/HTTPS but requires you to come up with a protocol yourself or use some other low-level protocol. This method allows for custom data exchange formats and can optimize performance by reducing the overhead associated with higher-level protocols.

See chapter xref:CH-IO[] for details on how sockets works.

Linked-in drivers in Erlang allow for the integration of C code directly into the Erlang runtime system, enabling high-performance operations and seamless interaction with external resources.

Linked-in drivers offer faster communication between Erlang and C code compared to external ports,
as they operate within the same process space, eliminating the overhead of inter-process communication.

For applications with stringent timing constraints, such as hardware interfacing or real-time data processing, linked-in drivers provide the necessary responsiveness.

However, linked-in drivers come with a higher risk of destabilizing the Erlang VM due to direct memory access and potential programming errors.

==== How to Implement a Linked-In Driver
Lets look at how to implement a linked-in driver in Erlang on three levels, first int the abstract what need to be done, then in some genarl psuedo code and finally in a full example.

To implement a linked-in driver in Erlang, follow these steps:

1. Write the C code for the driver, handling:
   A. Driver initialization
      * Define the `erl_drv_entry` struct with pointers to callback functions.
      * Register the driver using the `DRIVER_INIT` macro.
   B. Implement asynchronous operations
      * Handle driver callbacks for start, stop, and output operations.
      * Manage I/O events using functions like `driver_select`.
   C. Manage resource allocation and deallocation
      * Define a struct to hold driver-specific data.
      * Allocate resources during driver start and release them during stop.
2. Integrate with Erlang
   * Load the driver using `erl_ddll:load_driver/2`.
   * Create a port in Erlang to communicate with the driver.

Let os look at some psuedo code for a linked in driver going into a bit more detail of the steps above.

1. Write the C code for the driver:
A. **Driver Initialization:**

   - **Define the `erl_drv_entry` Struct:** This structure contains pointers to callback functions that the Erlang runtime system will invoke.

   - **Register the Driver:** Implement the `DRIVER_INIT` macro to initialize and register your driver with the Erlang runtime.

```c
   static ErlDrvEntry example_driver_entry = {
       NULL,                   // init
       example_drv_start,      // start
       example_drv_stop,       // stop
       example_drv_output,     // output
       NULL,                   // ready_input
       NULL,                   // ready_output
       "example_drv",          // driver_name
       NULL,                   // finish
       NULL,                   // handle
       NULL,                   // control
       NULL,                   // timeout
       NULL,                   // outputv
       NULL,                   // ready_async
       NULL,                   // flush
       NULL,                   // call
       NULL,                   // event
       ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER, // extended_marker
       ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION, // major_version
       ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MINOR_VERSION, // minor_version
       0,                      // driver_flags
       NULL,                   // handle2
       NULL,                   // process_exit
       NULL                    // stop_select
   };

   DRIVER_INIT(example_drv) {
       return &example_driver_entry;
   }
```


B. **Asynchronous Operations:**

   - **Handle Driver Callbacks:** Implement the necessary callback functions such as `example_drv_start`, `example_drv_stop`, and `example_drv_output` to manage driver operations.

   - **Manage I/O Events:** Utilize functions like `driver_select` to handle asynchronous I/O operations efficiently.

```c
   static ErlDrvData example_drv_start(ErlDrvPort port, char *command) {
       example_data* d = (example_data*)driver_alloc(sizeof(example_data));
       d->port = port;
       return (ErlDrvData)d;
   }

   static void example_drv_stop(ErlDrvData handle) {
       driver_free((char*)handle);
   }

   static void example_drv_output(ErlDrvData handle, char *buff, ErlDrvSizeT bufflen) {
       example_data* d = (example_data*)handle;
       // Process the input and produce output
       driver_output(d->port, output_data, output_len);
   }
```

C. **Resource Management:**

   - **Allocation and Deallocation:** Ensure proper memory management by allocating resources during driver start and releasing them during driver stop to prevent memory leaks.

```c
   typedef struct {
       ErlDrvPort port;
       // Additional driver-specific data
   } example_data;
```

2. **Integration with Erlang:**

   - **Loading the Driver:** Use `erl_ddll:load_driver/2` to load the shared library containing your driver.

   - **Opening the Port:** Create a port in Erlang using `open_port/2` with the `{spawn, DriverName}` tuple to communicate with the driver.

```erlang
   start(SharedLib) ->
       case erl_ddll:load_driver(".", SharedLib) of
           ok -> ok;
           {error, already_loaded} -> ok;
           _ -> exit({error, could_not_load_driver})
       end,
       Port = open_port({spawn, SharedLib}, []),
       loop(Port).
```

**Example Implementation**
Now lets look at a full example of a linked in driver that doubles an integer.


1. **C Driver:**

```c
#include "erl_driver.h"
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef struct {
    ErlDrvPort port;
} double_data;

// Start function: initialize driver state
static ErlDrvData double_drv_start(ErlDrvPort port, char *command) {
    double_data* d = (double_data*)driver_alloc(sizeof(double_data));
    d->port = port;
    return (ErlDrvData)d;
}

// Stop function: clean up resources
static void double_drv_stop(ErlDrvData handle) {
    driver_free((char*)handle);
}

// Output function: process data sent from Erlang
static void double_drv_output(ErlDrvData handle, char *buff, ErlDrvSizeT bufflen) {
    double_data* d = (double_data*)handle;

    // Convert input buffer to an integer
    int input = atoi(buff);

    // Perform the operation (double the input value)
    int result = input * 2;

    // Convert the result back to a string
    char result_str[32];
    snprintf(result_str, sizeof(result_str), "%d", result);

    // Send the result back to Erlang
    driver_output(d->port, result_str, strlen(result_str));
}

// Define the driver entry struct
static ErlDrvEntry double_driver_entry = {
    NULL,                      // init
    double_drv_start,          // start
    double_drv_stop,           // stop
    double_drv_output,         // output
    NULL,                      // ready_input
    NULL,                      // ready_output
    "double_drv",              // driver_name
    NULL,                      // finish
    NULL,                      // handle
    NULL,                      // control
    NULL,                      // timeout
    NULL,                      // outputv
    NULL,                      // ready_async
    NULL,                      // flush
    NULL,                      // call
    NULL,                      // event
    ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER,   // extended marker
    ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION, // major version
    ERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MINOR_VERSION, // minor version
    0,                         // driver flags
    NULL,                      // handle2
    NULL,                      // process_exit
    NULL                       // stop_select
};

// Driver initialization macro
DRIVER_INIT(double_drv) {
    return &double_driver_entry;
}
```

2. **Erlang Module:**

```erlang
-module(double).
-export([start/0, stop/0, double/1]).

start() ->
      SharedLib = "double_drv",
      case erl_ddll:load_driver(".", SharedLib) of
         ok -> ok;
         {error, already_loaded} -> ok;
         _ -> exit({error, could_not_load_driver})
      end,
      register(double_server, spawn(fun() -> init(SharedLib) end)).

init(SharedLib) ->
      Port = open_port({spawn, SharedLib}, []),
      loop(Port).

loop(Port) ->
      receive
         {double, Caller, N} ->
            Port ! {self(), {command, integer_to_list(N)}},
            receive
                  {Port, {data, Result}} ->
                     Caller ! {double_result, list_to_integer(Result)}
            end,
            loop(Port);
         stop ->
            Port ! {self(), close},
            receive
                  {Port, closed} -> exit(normal)
            end
      end.

double(N) ->
      double_server ! {double, self(), N},
      receive
         {double_result, Result} -> Result
      end.

stop() ->
      double_server ! stop.
```

The `double_drv_output` function is responsible for processing data sent from the Erlang runtime to the driver. It begins by converting the input string to an integer using `atoi`, performs the required operation of doubling the value, and then formats the result back into a string using `snprintf`. Finally, the result is sent back to the Erlang runtime using the `driver_output` function, enabling seamless communication between Erlang and the native code.

The `double_driver_entry` struct acts as the central definition for the driver, linking the Erlang runtime to the driver's core functionality. It contains pointers to callback functions such as `start`, `stop`, and `output`, which handle various aspects of the driver's lifecycle and interactions. Additionally, the `driver_name` field specifies the identifier used when loading the driver from Erlang. To complete the integration, the `DRIVER_INIT` macro registers the driver with the Erlang runtime by returning a pointer to the `double_driver_entry` struct, enabling the runtime to recognize and manage the driver effectively.

To test the Linked-In Driver first compile the C code into a shared library:

```bash
gcc -o double_drv.so -fPIC -shared double_drv.c -I /path/to/erlang/erts/include
```

If you are running the code in the devcontainer of the book:

```bash
cd /code/c_chapter
gcc -o double_drv.so -fPIC -shared -I /usr/local/lib/erlang/usr/include/ double_drv.c
```

Load the driver in Erlang:

Start the Erlang shell:
```bash
erl
```
Load the driver:
```erlang
1> c(double).
{ok,double}
2> double:start().
true
```

Call the Functionality:

```erlang
3> Result = double:double(21).
42
4> io:format("Doubled result: ~p~n", [Result]).
Double result: 42
ok
```

Stop the driver
```erlang
5> double:stop().
stop
6>
```
