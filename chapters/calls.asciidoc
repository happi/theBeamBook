=== Hot Code Loading

In Erlang there is a semantic difference between a local function call
and a remote function call. A remote call, that is a call to a
function in a named module, is guaranteed to go to the latest loaded
version of that module. A local call, an unqualified call to a function
within the same module, is guaranteed to go to the same version
of the code as the caller.

A call to a local function can be turned into a remote call by
specifying the module name at the call site. This is usually
done with the ?MODULE macro as in +?MODULE:foo()+.
A remote call to a non local module can not be turned into
a local call, i.e. there is no way to guarantee the version
of the callee in the caller.

This is an important feature of Erlang which makes _hot code loading_
or _hot upgrades_ possible. Just make sure you have a remote
call somewhere in your server loop and you can then load new code
into the system while it is running; when execution reaches the
remote call it will switch to executing the new code.

A common way of writing server loops is to have a local call
for the main loop and a code upgrade handler which does
a remote call and possibly a state upgrade:

[source,erlang]
------------------------------------------
loop(State) ->
  receive
    upgrade ->
       NewState = ?MODULE:code_upgrade(State),
       ?MODULE:loop(NewState);
     Msg ->
       NewState = handle_msg(Msg, State),
       loop(NewState)
   end.

------------------------------------------

With this construct, which is basically what `gen_server` uses,
the programmer has control over when and how a code upgrade is done.

The hot code upgrade is one of the most important features of Erlang
which makes it possible to write servers that operates 24/7 year out
and year in. It is also one of the main reasons why Erlang is
dynamically typed. It is very hard in a statically typed language to
give type for the `code_upgrade` function. (It is also hard to give the
type of the loop function). These types will change in the future as
the type of State changes to handle new features.

For a language implementer concerned with performance, the hot code
loading functionality is a burden though. Since each call to or from a
remote module can change to new code in the future it is very hard to
do whole program optimization across module boundaries. (Hard but not
impossible, there are solutions but so far I have not seen one fully
implemented).

=== Code Loading

Shouldn't Code Loading come before Hot Code Loading? Or are the two topics not related in that way? - bmacdonald

In the Erlang Runtime System the code loading is handled by the
code server. The code server will call the lower level BIFs in the
+erlang+ module for the actual loading. But the code server also
determines the purging policy.

The runtime system can keep two versions of each module, a _current_
version and an _old_ version. All fully qualified (remote) calls go
to the current version. Local calls in the old version and return
addresses on the stack can still go to the old version.

If a third version of a module is loaded and there are still processes
running (have pointers on the stack to) the code server
will kill those processes and purge the old code. Then the current
version will become old and the third version will be loaded as the
current version.
