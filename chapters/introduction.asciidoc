== Introducing the Erlang Runtime System

The Erlang RunTime System (ERTS) ((("Erlang RunTime System",
see="ERTS")))(((ERTS))) is a complex system with many interdependent
components. It is written in a very portable way so that it can run on
anything from a gum stick computer to the largest multicore system
with terabytes of memory. In order to be able to optimize the
performance of such a system for your application, you need to not
only know your application, but you also need to have a thorough
understanding of ERTS itself.

=== ERTS and the Erlang Runtime System

There is a difference between any Erlang Runtime System ((("Erlang
Runtime System"))) and a specific implementation of an Erlang Runtime
System. "Erlang/OTP" by Ericsson is the de facto standard
implementation of Erlang and the Erlang Runtime System. In this book I
will refer to this implementation as _ERTS_ or spelled out _Erlang
RunTime System_ with a capital T. (See xref:ERTS[] for a definition of
OTP).

There is no official definition of what an Erlang Runtime System is,
or what an Erlang Virtual Machine is. You could sort of imagine what
such an ideal Platonic system would look like by taking ERTS and
removing all the implementation specific details. This is
unfortunately a circular definition, since you need to know the
general definition to be able to identify an implementation specific
detail. In the Erlang world we are usually too pragmatic to worry about
this.

We will try to use the term _Erlang Runtime System_ to refer to the
general idea of any Erlang Runtime System as opposed to the specific
implementation by Ericsson which we call the Erlang RunTime System
or usually just ERTS.

*Note* This book is mostly a book about ERTS in particular and only to
a small extent about any general Erlang Runtime System. If you assume
that we talk about the Ericsson implementation unless it is clearly
stated that we are talking about a general principle you will probably
be right.

=== How to read this book

In xref:P-Running[] of this book we will look at how to tune the
runtime system for your application and how to profile and debug
your application and the runtime system. In order to really know
how to tune the system you also need to know the system. In
xref:P-ERTS[] of this book you will get a deep understanding of
how the runtime system works.

The following chapters of xref:P-ERTS[] will go over each
component of the system by itself.
You should be able to read any one of these
chapters without having a full understanding of how the other
components are implemented, but you will need a basic understanding of
what each component is. The rest of this introductory chapter should
give you enough basic understanding and vocabulary to be able to jump
between the rest of the chapters in part one in any order you like.

However, if you have the time,
read the book in
order the first time. Words that are specific to Erlang and ERTS or
used in a specific way in this book are usually explained at their
first occurrence. Then, when you know the vocabulary, you can come
back and use Part I as a reference whenever you have a problem with a
particular component.

[[ERTS]]
=== ERTS

In this there is a basic overview of the main components of
ERTS (((ERTS))) and some vocabulary needed to understand the more
detailed descriptions of each component in the following chapters.

==== The Erlang Node (ERTS)

When you start an Elixir or Erlang application or system, what you
really start is an Erlang node(((node))). The node runs the Erlang
RunTime System and the virtual machine BEAM.  (or possibly another
implementation of Erlang (see xref:Other_Erlang_Implementations[])).

Your application code will run in an Erlang node, and all the layers
of the node will affect the performance of your application. We will
look at the stack of layers that makes up a node. This will help you
understand your options for running your system in different
environments.

In OO terminology one could say that an Erlang node is an object of
the Erlang Runtime System class. The equivalent in the Java world is a
JVM instance.

All execution of Elixir/Erlang code is done within a node. An Erlang node
runs in one OS process, and you can have several Erlang nodes
running on one machine.


To be completely correct according to the Erlang OTP documentation a
node is actually an executing runtime system that has been given a
name. That is, if you start Elixir without giving a name through one
of the command line switches `--name NAME@HOST` or `--sname NAME` (or
`-name` and `-sname` for an Erlang runtime.)  you will have a runtime
but not a node. In such a system the function `Node.alive?` 
(or in Erlang `is_alive()`) returns false.

----
$ iex
Erlang/OTP 19 [erts-8.1] [source-0567896] [64-bit] [smp:4:4]
              [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Interactive Elixir (1.4.0) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(1)> Node.alive?
false
iex(2)>
----

The runtime system itself is not that strict in its use
of the terminology. You can ask for the name of the node even
if you didn't give it a name. In Elixir you use the function
`Node.list` with the argument `:this`, and in Erlang you
call `nodes(this).`:

----
iex(2)> Node.list :this
[:nonode@nohost]
iex(3)>
----

In this book we will use the term node for any running instance
of the runtime whether it is given a name or not.

==== Layers in the Execution Environment

Your program (application) will run in one or more nodes, and the
performance of your program will depend not only on your application
code but also on all the layers below your code in the _ERTS
stack_. In xref:the_erts_stack[] you can see the ERTS Stack
illustrated with two Erlang nodes running on one machine.

If you are using Elixir there is yet another layer to the stack.

Let's look at each layer of the stack and see how you can tune them
to your application's need.

At the bottom of the stack there is the hardware you are running
on. The easiest way to improve the performance of your app is probably
to run it on better hardware. You might need to start exploring higher
levels of the stack if economical or physical constraints or
environmental concerns won't let you upgrade your hardware.

The two most important choices for your hardware
is whether it is multicore and whether it is 32-bit or 64-bit. You
need different builds of ERTS depending on whether you want to use
multicore or not and whether you want to use 32-bit or 64-bit.

The second layer in the stack is the OS level. ERTS runs on most
versions of Windows and most POSIX "compliant" operating systems,
including Linux, VxWorks, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Mac OS X. Today most of
the development of ERTS is done on Linux and OS X, and you can expect
the best performance on these platforms. However, Ericsson has been
using Solaris internally in many projects and ERTS has been tuned for
Solaris for many years.  Depending on your use case you might actually
get the best performance on a Solaris system. The OS choice is usually
not based on performance requirements, but is restricted by other
factors. If you are building an embedded application you might be
restricted to Raspbian or VxWork, and if you for some reason are
building an end user or client application you might have to use
Windows. The Windows port of ERTS has so far not had the highest
priority and might not be the best choice from a performance or
maintenance perspective. If you want to use a 64-bit ERTS you of
course need to have both a 64-bit machine and a 64-bit OS. We will not
cover many OS specific questions in this book, and most examples will
be assuming that you run on Linux.

The third layer in the stack is the Erlang Runtime System. In our case
this will be ERTS. This and the fourth layer, the Erlang Virtual Machine
(BEAM), is what this book is all about.

The fifth layer, OTP(((OTP))), supplies the Erlang standard libraries. OTP
originally stood for "Open Telecom Platform" and was a number of
Erlang libraries supplying building blocks (such as `supervisor`,
`gen_server` and `gen_tcp`) for building robust applications (such as
telephony exchanges).  Early on, the libraries and the meaning of OTP
got intermingled with all the other standard libraries shipped with
ERTS. Nowadays most people use OTP together with Erlang in
"Erlang/OTP" as the name for ERTS and all Erlang libraries shipped by
Ericsson. Knowing these standard libraries and how and when to use
them can greatly improve the performance of your application. This
book will not go into any details of the standard libraries and
OTP, there are many other books that cover these aspects.

If you are running an Elixir program the sixth layer provides
the Elixir environment and the Elixir libraries.

Finally, the seventh layer (APP) is your application, and
any third party libraries you use. The application can use all
the functionality provided by the underlying layers. Apart from
upgrading your hardware this is probably the place where you most
easily can improve your application's performance. In
xref:CH-Tracing[] there are some hints and some tools that can
help you profile and optimize your application. In
xref:CH-Debugging[] we will look at how to find the cause
of crashing applications and how to find bugs in your application.

For information on how to build and run an Erlang node
see xref:CH-BuildingERTS[], and read the rest of the book to
learn all about the components of an Erlang node.

==== Distribution


One of the key insights by the Erlang language designers was that in
order to build a system that works 24/7 you need to be able to handle
hardware failure. Therefore you need to distribute your system over at
least two physical machines. You do this by starting a node on
each machine and then you can connect the nodes to each other so
that processes can communicate with each other across the nodes
just as if they were running in the same node.

==== The Erlang Compiler

The Erlang Compiler is responsible for compiling Erlang source code,
from .erl files into virtual machine code for BEAM (the virtual
machine). The compiler itself is written in Erlang and compiled by
itself to BEAM code and usually available in a running Erlang node.
To bootstrap the runtime system there are a number of precompiled
BEAM files, including the compiler, in the bootstrap directory.

For more information about the compiler see xref:CH-Compiler[].


==== The Erlang Virtual Machine: BEAM

BEAM(((BEAM))) is the Erlang virtual machine used for executing Erlang code,
just like the JVM is used for executing Java code. BEAM runs in an
Erlang Node.

****
*BEAM:* The name BEAM originally stood for Bogdan's Erlang Abstract
 Machine, but nowadays most people refer to it as Bj&ouml;rn's
Erlang Abstract Machine, after the current maintainer.
 
****

Just as ERTS is an implementation of a more general concept of a Erlang
Runtime System so is BEAM an implementation of a more general Erlang Virtual
Machine (EVM)(((Erlang Virtual Machine)))(((EVM, see="Erlang Virtual Machine"))).
There is no definition of what constitutes an EVM but BEAM actually has two
levels of instructions _Generic Instructions_ and _Specific Instructions_.
The generic instruction set could be seen as a blueprint for an EVM.

For a full description of BEAM see xref:CH-BEAM[], xref:CH-beam_modules[]
and xref:CH-Instructions[].

==== Processes

An Erlang process basically works like an OS process. Each process has
its own memory (a mailbox, a heap and a stack) and a process control
block (PCB) with information about the process.

All Erlang code execution is done within the context of a process. One
Erlang node can have many processes, which can communicate through
message passing and signals. Erlang processes can also communicate with
processes on other Erlang nodes as long as the nodes are connected.

To learn more about processes and the PCB see xref:CH-Processes[].


==== Scheduling

The Scheduler is responsible for choosing the Erlang process to execute.
Basically the scheduler keeps two queues, a _ready queue_ of processes
ready to run, and a _waiting queue_ of processes waiting to receive a
message. When a process in the waiting queue receives a message or gets
a time out it is moved to the ready queue.

The scheduler picks the first process from the ready queue and hands it
to BEAM for execution of one _time slice_. BEAM preempts the running
process when the time slice is used up and adds the process to the
end of the ready queue. If the process is blocked in a receive before
the time slice is used up, it gets added to the waiting queue instead.

Erlang is concurrent by nature, that is, each process is conceptually
running at the same time as all other processes, but in reality there
is just one process running in the VM. On a multicore machine Erlang
actually runs more than one scheduler, usually one per physical core,
each having their own queues. This way Erlang achieves true
parallelism. To utilize more than one core ERTS has to be built (see
xref:CH-BuildingERTS[]) in _SMP_(((SMP))) mode. SMP stands for
_Symmetric MultiProcessing_, that is, the ability to execute a
processes on any one of multiple CPUs.

In reality the picture is more complicated with priorities among
processes and the waiting queue is implemented through a timing wheel.
All this and more is described in detail in xref:CH-Scheduling[].

==== The Erlang Tag Scheme

Erlang is a dynamically typed language, and the runtime system needs a
way to keep track of the type of each data object. This is done with a
tagging scheme. Each data object or pointer to a data object also has
a tag with information about the data type of the object.

Basically some bits of a pointer are reserved for the tag, and the
emulator can then determine the type of the object by looking at the
bit pattern of the tag.

These tags are used for pattern matching and for type test and for
primitive operations as well as by the garbage collector.

The complete tagging scheme is described in xref:CH-TypeSystem[].

==== Memory Handling

Erlang uses automatic memory management and the programmer does not
have to worry about memory allocation and deallocation. Each process
has a heap and a stack which both can grow, and shrink, as needed.

When a process runs out of heap space, the VM will first try to
reclaim free heap space through garbage collection. The garbage collector
will then go through the process stack and heap and copy live data
to a new heap while throwing away all the data that is dead. If there
still isn't enough heap space, a new larger heap will be allocated and
the live data is moved there.

The details of the current generational copying garbage collector, including
the handling of reference counted binaries can be found in xref:CH-Memory[].

In a system which uses HiPE compiled native code, each process actually has
two stacks, a BEAM stack and a native stack, the details can be found in
xref:CH-Native[].

==== The Interpreter and the Command Line Interface

When you start an Erlang node with +erl+ you get a command prompt.
This is the _Erlang read eval print loop_ (REPL) or the _command line
interface_ (CLI) or simply the _Erlang shell_.

You can actually type in Erlang code and execute it directly from the
shell. In this case the code is not compiled to BEAM code and executed by
the BEAM, instead the code is parsed and interpreted by the Erlang
interpreter. In general the interpreted code behaves exactly as compiled
code, but there are a few subtle differences, these differences and all
other aspects of the shell are explained in xref:CH-Ops[].

[[Other_Erlang_Implementations]]
=== Other Erlang Implementations

This book is mainly concerned with the "standard" Erlang
implementation by Ericsson/OTP called ERTS, but there are a few other
implementations available and in this section we will look at some of
them briefly.

==== Erlang on Xen

Erlang on Xen (link:http://erlangonxen.org[]) is an Erlang implementation
running directly on server hardware with no OS layer in between, only
a thin Xen client.

Ling, the virtual machine of Erlang on Xen is almost 100% binary compatible
with BEAM. In xref:the_eox_stack you can see how the Erlang on Xen implementation
of the Erlang Solution Stack differs from the ERTS Stack. The thing to note here
is that there is no operating system in the Erlang on Xen stack.

Since Ling implements the generic instruction set of BEAM, it can reuse
the BEAM compiler from the OTP layer to compile Erlang to Ling.

==== Erjang

Erjang (link:http://www.erjang.org[]) is an Erlang implementation which runs
on the JVM. It loads +.beam+ files and recompiles the code to Java +.class+
files. Erjang is almost 100% binary compatible with (generic) BEAM.

In xref:the_erjang_stack you can see how the Erjang implementation
of the Erlang Solution Stack differs from the ERTS Stack. The thing
to note here is that JVM has replaced BEAM as the virtual machine
and that Erjang provides the services of ERTS by implementing them
in Java on top of the VM.

Now that you have a basic understanding of all the major pieces of
ERTS, and the necessary vocabulary you can dive into the details of
each component. If you are eager to understand a certain component,
you can jump directly to that chapter. Or if you are really eager to
find a solution to a specific problem you could jump to the right
chapter in xref:P-Running[], and try the different methods to tune,
tweak, or debug your system.
